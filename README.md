## open_iA Superbuild

The intention behind this project is to simplify setting up the build environment of [open_iA](https://github.com/3dct/open_iA).
The instructions here therefore can be seen as an alternative to [the build instructions in the open_iA repository](https://github.com/3dct/open_iA/wiki/Linux-Build).
The build steps here were tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1. On other operating systems, the names of the packages to install might vary slightly.

## Build steps

1. Install required applications and libraries (CMake, g++, make, git, OpenCL, OpenGL, Qt):
  
  $ sudo apt install cmake g++ make git \
    libgl1-mesa-dev libxt-dev \
    ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers opencl-clhpp-headers \
    qtbase5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev qttools5-dev qt5-default \
    libxt-dev libqt5opengl5-dev

2. Open a shell in the folder where you want to place open_iA (preferrably, use a short folder name, e.g. directly in "/home/youruser")

3. Clone this repository:
  
  $ git clone https://github.com/3dct/open_iA-superbuild.git

4. Enter the newly created working copy:
  
  $ cd open_iA-superbuild

5. Execute cmake:
  
  $ cmake .

6. Build everything:
  
  $ make -j 4
  
7. When finished successfully, open_iA executables will be built in the `open_iA/bin/bin` subdirectory of where you issued `make`!

If CMake encounters an error, it probably will tell you that some library is missing which you still need to install.
If there is any error you cannot fix yourself, feel free to [post an issue](https://github.com/3dct/open_iA-superbuild/issues)!

## Adaptations / Optimizations of the above procedure:

- If you have more than 4 cores in your system, you will probably want to increase the number 4 in step 6 above to that number, e.g.

  $ make -j 8

- If you'd like to rename the `open_iA-superbuild` folder created in step 3 above:
  - Either add the desired folder name as additional parameter to the command line given above, e.g.:
  
    $ git clone https://github.com/3dct/open_iA-superbuild.git my_open_iA
  
  - Or rename the folder directly after cloning, i.e., after step 3, do:

    $ mv open_iA-superbuild my_open_iA
    
- If you want to put the build environment for open_iA somewhere else as where you checked out the superbuild,
  or if you want to keep the root folder of the superbuild clear (i.e. if you want to do a so-called out-of-source build),
  you can also call CMake from another folder; the relative path given as parameter just has to reference the superbuild directory.

  For example:
  If you checked out this repository to /home/youruser/open_iA-superbuild,
  and want to create the build environment, in /home/youruser/open_iA_Env, then, instead of step 5 above, execute:

  $ mkdir /home/youruser/open_iA_Env
  $ cd /home/youruser/open_iA_Env
  $ cmake /home/youruser/open_iA-superbuild

- You can change the build tool by modifying the CMakeLists.txt in the open_iA-superbuild folder after step 3.
  Search for the line `SET (CMAKE_GENERATOR "Unix Makefiles")` and change it to e.g. `SET (CMAKE_GENERATOR "ninja")`.
  Note that you probably need to execute the cmake command twice before this change will be used everywhere!
